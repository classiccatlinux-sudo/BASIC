# BASIC - 1.0 - FOSS - classic14

# about
BASIC is made to make coding in python even more easy.
its made by classic14 (me) and is very easy to work with.
its FOSS and made for linux and macOS and also windows.
but its best for linux. it works on most linux distros 
but works best on debian.

# here is how you use BASIC
ok lets look at a file using basic this is how it would look:

1. from BASIC import * <---- this imports all the features from BASIC. but
you need to have your main python file in the same folder as BASIC for 
it to work.

2. used() <---- this prints: BASIC was used in this program. this is called a module
its from the BASIC file. its not a lot to type but it does this: print("BASIC was used in this program")
with just this: used() SEE! thats a lot more easy now lets look at all of the modules:

# modules

1. time1 - waits 1 seconds

2. time3 - waits 3 seconds

3. time5 - you get it

4. clear() - clears the screen 

5. used() - prints BASIC was used in this program

6. reboot - reboots the system

7. update_debian - updates a debian based linux systems so linux mint and ubuntu to (needs sudo but will ask first) (only works on debian linux)

thats all for now!
