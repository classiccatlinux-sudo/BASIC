BASIC - 1.0 - FOSS - classic14
About

BASIC is made to make coding in Python even easier.
It’s made by classic14 (me) and is very easy to work with.
It’s FOSS and works on Linux, macOS, and also Windows,
but it’s best for Linux. It works on most Linux distros,
but works best on Debian.

Here is how you use BASIC

Ok, let’s look at a file using BASIC. This is how it would look:

from BASIC import *
<---- This imports all the features from BASIC.
You need to have your main Python file in the same folder as BASIC for it to work.

used()
<---- This prints: BASIC was used in this program.
This is called a module; it’s from the BASIC file.
It’s not a lot to type, but it does this:
print("BASIC was used in this program")
with just this: used(). SEE! That’s a lot easier.

Now let’s look at all of the modules:

Modules

time1 – waits 1 second

time3 – waits 3 seconds

time5 – you get it

clear() – clears the screen

used() – prints “BASIC was used in this program”

reboot – reboots the system

update_debian – updates Debian-based Linux systems, like Linux Mint and Ubuntu
(needs sudo but will ask first) (only works on Debian Linux)

That’s all for now!
